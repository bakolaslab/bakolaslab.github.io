## About Me
[Vrushabh Zinage](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrushabh-zinage/) is a PhD student at UT Austin in Aerospace Engineering advised by Prof. Efstathios Bakolas and Prof. Takashi Tanaka. He is broadly interested in the intersection of motion planning, trajectory optimization, control theory, data-driven control, and robotics. His current research includes learning based control, operator theoretic control of nonlinear systems, information-theoretic motion planning, and safety-critical control theory using Control Barrier Functions.

He has previously interned at GAMMA Lab. of the University of Maryland under the advise of Prof. Dinesh Manocha on online motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithms. He has also interned at Airbus and Honeywell Aerospace, India.

Prior to joining UT, he worked with Prof. Satadal Ghosh on developing fast and efficient sampling-based motion planning and trajectory optimization based algorithms during his bachelor's at IIT Madras.

<!-- ## My interests
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Methods for rigorous uncertainty quantification, especially in deep learning
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.  -->
