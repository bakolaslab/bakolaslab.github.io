## About Me
[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrushabh-zinage/) am a PhD student at UT Austin in Aerospace Engineering advised by Prof. Efstathios Bakolas and Prof. Takashi Tanaka. I am broadly interested in the intersection of motion planning, trajectory optimization, control theory, data-driven control, and robotics. My current research includes learning based control, operator theoretic control of nonlinear systems, information-theoretic motion planning, and safety-critical control theory using Control Barrier Functions.

I have previously interned at GAMMA Lab. of the University of Maryland under the advise of Prof. Dinesh Manocha on online motion planning and trajectory optimization algorithms. I have also interned at Airbus and Honeywell Aerospace, India.

Prior to joining UT, I worked with Prof. Satadal Ghosh on developing fast and efficient sampling-based motion planning and trajectory optimization based algorithms during my bachelor's at IIT Madras.

<!-- ## My interests
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Methods for rigorous uncertainty quantification, especially in deep learning
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.  -->
