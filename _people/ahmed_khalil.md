## About Me
My research interests lie in multi-agent control and optimization.

I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/programs/degrees/mechanical-engineering-bs/), and completed a summer study abroad at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
