## About Me
I am a graduate student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), fortunate to be advised by Dr. Efstathios Bakolas. My interests lie in multi-agent control and optimization.

I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/programs/degrees/mechanical-engineering-bs/), and completed a study abroad at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) during the summer of 2019.
