## About Me

<!-- ## My interests
Broadly interested in data, machine learning, and brains. I've done a lot of work with EEG and human memory in the past. Right now I'm excited about:
* Methods for rigorous uncertainty quantification, especially in deep learning
* Decoding brain activity using machine learning + applying to closed-loop algorithms
* Transfer learning / domain adaptation
* Open science initiatives, esp. tools for data standardization and sharing.  -->
